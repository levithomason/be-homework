## Hello there fellow coder

Within this plunkr, you'll find your building data ready to be used in data.js,
set to the global `global_data`. Each object of `global_data` contains the 
following: `cost`, `model_yeal`, and `MPG`.

We need some help analysing this car data. One of our fake customers would like to 
see how the data looks in an interactive way.

## what to do
We'd like to see an interactive chart that show the following: 
- histogram of `MPG` (x-axis) by the count on the y-axis
- a range filter for `model_year` (e.g. filter by model_year greater than 1980 and less than 1990)
- filter out `null` values
- toggle to remove low MPG data (`MPG` < 1.0)
- indicator of how many buildings are in the histogram
- stats for the data shown
  - min
  - max
  - standard deviation
  - mean
  - median


## rules and info
- please use any library you'd like: angular, ember, d3, bootstrap, ...
  - most JS libraries can be added from the "external libraries" link in the right nav bar
- please don't reach out for help other than the internet at large (i.e. don't pair)
- don't worry about tests (unless TDD/BDD is your way of life), but be prepared 
  to talk about how you'd test your solution
- don't spend more than an hour or two, we hope this is fun, if it's taking too 
  long, we probably didn't provide enough infomation, so reach out to us
- if plunkr is seriously hindering your style, feel free to zip up your code and
   email it over
